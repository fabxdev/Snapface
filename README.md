## Introduction

SnapFace is a web application project that I am developing as part of the Angular course on OpenClassroom. This project is designed to showcase my learning journey in web development and highlight my growing expertise in Angular.

The primary goal of this project is to build a functional application using Angular, while implementing the concepts covered in the 10-hour basic Angular course. Through SnapFace, I have gained hands-on experience in creating components, implementing routing, and utilizing directives such as `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngStyle`, and `*ngClass`.

## Project Features

- Component Creation: I have learned how to design and create Angular components, enabling modular and reusable code.
- Routing: SnapFace incorporates routing to navigate between different views within the application.
- Directives: I have successfully applied directives like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngStyle`, and `*ngClass` to enhance the user interface and interactivity of the application.

## Motivation

As a web and mobile developer in training, I am determined to master Angular and further enhance my skills in front-end development. SnapFace represents a significant step in this journey, showcasing my dedication to learning and my ability to apply theoretical concepts in a practical setting.

## Future Plans

I am currently in the midst of my web/mobile developer training and am actively seeking to improve my proficiency with Angular. Moving forward, I plan to continue expanding the functionality of SnapFace, incorporating more advanced features and techniques that I will learn throughout my training.
